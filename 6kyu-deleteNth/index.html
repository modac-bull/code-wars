        Enough is enough! Alice and Bob were on a holiday. Both of them took
        many pictures of the places they've been, and now they want to show
        Charlie their entire collection. However, Charlie doesn't like these
        sessions, since the motif usually repeats. He isn't fond of seeing the
        Eiffel tower 40 times. He tells them that he will only sit for the
        session if they show the same motif at most N times. Luckily, Alice and
        Bob are able to encode the motif as a number. Can you help them to
        remove numbers such that their list contains each number only up to N
        times, without changing the order? Task Given a list and a number,
        create a new list that contains each number of list at most N times,
        without reordering. For example if the input number is 2, and the input
        list is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next [1,2]
        since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then
        take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3]. With list [20,37,20,21] and number
        1, the result would be [20,37,21].
