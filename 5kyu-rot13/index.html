  <h1>ROT13</h1>
  <p>How can you tell an extrovert from an introvert at NSA? Va gur ryringbef, gur rkgebireg ybbxf ng gur BGURE thl'f
    fubrf.

    I found this joke on USENET, but the punchline is scrambled. Maybe you can decipher it? According to Wikipedia,
    ROT13 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) is frequently used to obfuscate jokes on USENET.

    Hint: For this task you're only supposed to substitue characters. Not spaces, punctuation, numbers etc.

    Test examples:

    "EBG13 rknzcyr." -->
    "ROT13 example."

    "This is my first ROT13 excercise!" -->
    "Guvf vf zl svefg EBG13 rkprepvfr!"</p>
