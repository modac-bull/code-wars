        Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they
        will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has
        an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it
        means they are in love. Write a function that will take the number of
        petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if
        they aren't.
