    <h1 class="title">Build Tower</h1>
    <p class="desc">Build a pyramid-shaped tower, as an array/list of strings, given a positive integer number of floors. A tower block is represented with "*" character.

      For example, a tower with 3 floors looks like this:
      
      [
        "  *  ",
        " *** ", 
        "*****"
      ]
      And a tower with 6 floors looks like this:
      
      [
        "     *     ", 
        "    ***    ", 
        "   *****   ", 
        "  *******  ", 
        " ********* ", 
        "***********"
      ]</p>
