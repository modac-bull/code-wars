    <h1 class="title">Find the unique number</h1>
    <p class="desc">There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

      findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
      findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
      Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.
      
      The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.
      
      This is the first kata in series:
