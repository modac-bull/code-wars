    <p class="desc">
      Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

      If you want to know more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA
      
      In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

      Example: (input --> output)
      
      "ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
      "GTAT" --> "CATA"</p>
