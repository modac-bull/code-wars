      <p class="desc">
        You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a
        perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so
        you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city
        provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones --
        everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter
        strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You
        always walk only a single block for each letter (direction) and you know
        it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function
        that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you
        exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of
        course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise. Note:
        you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of
        direction letters ('n', 's', 'e', or 'w' only). It will never give you
        an empty array (that's not a walk, that's standing still!).
