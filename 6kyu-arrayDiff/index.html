    <p class="desc">Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

      It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.
      
      arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
      If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:
      
      arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]</p>
